# SIEM Sensors Plugin for GLPI
Example plugin for GLPI's new SIEM module. Do not use in production.
Provides a few basic sensors for monitoring services such as ping and SNMP.

Requires symfony/process. Run "composer require symfony/process" to install it.

The current examples should be considered WIP until the 10.0.0 release of GLPI.
